# OCI CreateContainer hook: materialize a flox env as a fine-grained symlink farm
# in the container rootfs.
#
# Why a symlink farm rather than the older overlay-mount of .flox:
# A flox env's static half (env/manifest.toml + env/manifest.lock) is immutable
# and lives in /nix/store, which the container already sees (the nix-store
# overlay lowers from the host store). Only flox's run/, cache/, and log/ are
# mutable. So we build a REAL local .flox directory whose env/ is a symlink into
# the store and whose run/cache/log are real writable dirs.
#
# The split MUST be at .flox-internal granularity. Symlinking the whole .flox
# into the store makes flox resolve run/ relative to the symlink's real target
# and try to create a GC root inside /nix/store, which nix refuses
# ("creating a garbage collector root ... in the Nix store is forbidden").
# See docs/flox-store-resolved-runtime-and-builder.adoc.
#
# Runs in the container's mount namespace before pivot_root (CreateContainer),
# so paths written here persist into the running container.
#
# Reads the OCI container state JSON on stdin to extract the bundle path; the
# container rootfs is "${bundle}/rootfs".
#
# Usage: flox-nri-env-link-hook.sh <env-store-path> <target-flox-dir>
#   <env-store-path>  absolute /nix/store path of the env subtree exposing env/
#                     (i.e. <store-path>/env/{manifest.toml,manifest.lock}).
#   <target-flox-dir> absolute path inside the container (e.g. /root/.flox) where
#                     the .flox symlink farm is materialized.
#
# Logging: to the hook's own stdout/stderr, captured by the OCI runtime — no
# logger(1)/journald reroute (a CreateContainer hook runs before pivot_root where
# /dev/log and /dev/fd may be absent, which would fail the hook at exit 127).
